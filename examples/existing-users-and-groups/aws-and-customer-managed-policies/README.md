# Deployment with AWS Managed Customer Managed Policies

This example shows how you can leverage **AWS Managed** and **Customer Managed** Policies to grant access to your users/groups for your desired AWS accounts.

## IMPORTANT!

If you wish to use customer managed policies, the policy must exist in **EVERY** AWS account that you wish to use it in for your permission set(s). If not, you will receive an error and the account assignment will fail.
