# AWS IAM Identity Center Terraform Module

## Features

- Dynamic User Creation
- Dynamic Group Creation
- Dynamic Group Membership Creation
- Dynamic Permission Set Creation
- Dynamic Account Assignment Creation
- Dynamic Reference of Existing Users
- Dynamic Reference of Existing Groups
- AWS Managed Policy Support
- Customer Managed Policy Support

## Important

- Locals are used to allow for global changes to multiple account assignments. If hard coding the account ids for your account assignments, you would need to change them in every place you want to reference the value. To simplify this, we recommend storing your desired account ids in [local values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals). See the `examples` directory for more information and sample code.
- When using **Customer Managed Policies** with account assignments, you must ensure these policies exist in all target accounts **before** using the module. Failure to do this will cause deployment errors because IAM Identity Center will attempt to reference policies that do not exist.

## Basic Usage - Create Users and Groups with AWS Managed Policies

```hcl
// This is a template file for a basic deployment.
// Modify the parameters below with actual values

module "aws-iam-identity-center" {
  source = "aws-ia/iam-identity-center/aws"

  // Create desired GROUPS in IAM Identity Center
  sso_groups = {
    Admin : {
      group_name        = "Admin"
      group_description = "Admin IAM Identity Center Group"
    },
    Dev : {
      group_name        = "Dev"
      group_description = "Dev IAM Identity Center Group"
    },
    QA : {
      group_name        = "QA"
      group_description = "QA IAM Identity Center Group"
    },
    Audit : {
      group_name        = "Audit"
      group_description = "Audit IAM Identity Center Group"
    },
  }

  // Create desired USERS in IAM Identity Center
  sso_users = {
    nuzumaki : {
      group_membership = ["Admin", "Dev", "QA", "Audit"]
      user_name        = "nuzumaki"
      given_name       = "Naruto"
      family_name      = "Uzumaki"
      email            = "nuzumaki@hiddenleaf.village"
    },
    suchiha : {
      group_membership = ["QA", "Audit"]
      user_name        = "suchiha"
      given_name       = "Sasuke"
      family_name      = "Uchiha"
      email            = "suchiha@hiddenleaf.village"
    },
  }

  // Create permissions sets backed by AWS managed policies
  permission_sets = {
    AdministratorAccess = {
      description          = "Provides AWS full access permissions.",
      session_duration     = "PT4H", // how long until session expires - this means 4 hours. max is 12 hours
      aws_managed_policies = ["arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"]

      aws_managed_policies = ["arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess"]
      tags                 = { ManagedBy = "Terraform" }
    },
    CustomPermissionAccess = {
      description          = "Provides CustomPoweruser permissions.",
      session_duration     = "PT3H", // how long until session expires - this means 3 hours. max is 12 hours
      aws_managed_policies = [
        "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess",
        "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess",
      ]
      inline_policy        = data.aws_iam_policy_document.CustomPermissionInlinePolicy.json

      // Only either managed_policy_arn or customer_managed_policy_reference can be specified.
      // Before using customer_managed_policy_reference, first deploy the policy to the account.
      // Don't in-place managed_policy_arn to/from customer_managed_policy_reference, delete it once.
      permissions_boundary = {
        // managed_policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess"

        customer_managed_policy_reference = {
          name = "ExamplePermissionsBoundaryPolicy"
          // path = "/"
        }
      }
      tags                 = { ManagedBy = "Terraform" }
    },
  }

  // Assign users/groups access to accounts with the specified permissions
  account_assignments = {
    Admin : {
      principal_name  = "Admin"                                   // name of the user or group you wish to have access to the account(s)
      principal_type  = "GROUP"                                   // entity type (user or group) you wish to have access to the account(s)
      permission_sets = ["AdministratorAccess", "ViewOnlyAccess"] // permissions the user/group will have in the account(s)
      account_ids = [                                             // account(s) the group will have access to. Permissions they will have in account are above line
      "111111111111", // replace with your desired account id
      "222222222222", // replace with your desired account id
      ]
    },
    Audit : {
      principal_name  = "Audit"
      principal_type  = "GROUP"
      permission_sets = ["ViewOnlyAccess"]

    },
  }

}
